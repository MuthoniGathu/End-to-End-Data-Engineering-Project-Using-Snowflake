# End-to-End-Data-Engineering-Project-Using-Snowflake
### Description
This project showcases an end-to-end data pipeline for extracting movie-related information from [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started), transforming it using Python, and loading it into Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehouse. The goal is to create a streamlined process that enables users to explore and analyze movie data using Power BI for insightful visualizations.
